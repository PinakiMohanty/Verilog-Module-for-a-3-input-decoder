# Verilog-Module-for-a-3-input-decoder
Verilog Module for a 3-input decoder using primitive instantiations, Continuous assignment statements and Conditional statements. Then we will write a testbench to simulate the 3 modules and verify using the waveforms. Verilog is a hardware description language for describing hardware from transistor level to behavioral.
